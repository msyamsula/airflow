scenario:
	i have database "source_db", table users with fields
		id, int
		username, string
		address, string
		is_active, string (yes|no)
		domicile, string
		balance, decimal
		point, decimal (1 poin equals to 10 rp)
	then i want to extract the data, and do following transform
		id -> leave at it is
		username -> change field name into user
		address -> leave at it is
		domicile -> drop it
		is_active -> transofrm into bool
        balance -> change to decimal(15,2)
        point -> change to decimal(15,2)
		net_worth -> sum of balance and point (net_worth = balance + 10 * point)
    load it into database "sink_db", table linkaja_user

	- backlink, scheduler, and other time dependent variables
	- check behaviour when dag fail
    - send notif when dag run fail
