scenarios:
One (transform one to one table):
	i have database "source_db", table users with fields
		id, int
		username, string
		address, string
		is_active, string (yes|no)
		domicile, string
		balance, decimal
		point, decimal (1 poin equals to 10 rp)
	then i want to extract the data, and do following transform
		id -> leave at it is
		username -> change field name into user
		address -> leave at it is
		domicile -> drop it
		is_active -> transofrm into bool
        balance -> change to decimal(15,2)
        point -> change to decimal(15,2)
		net_worth -> sum of balance and point (net_worth = balance + 10 * point)
    load it into database "sink_db", table linkaja_user
Two (joining two tables):
	i have database "source_db", table "users" (as in scenario one), "account", and "full_service"
	account's fields are:
		id, int
		user_id, int, foreign key from table "users"
		account_name, string
	full_service's fields are:
		account_id, int, foreign key from table "account"
		full_service, bool
	I want to join this two table to become "linkaja_account"
		id, int --> refer to account_id
		account_name, string
		full_service, bool
	load it to database "sink_db"


to-do :
	- backlink, scheduler, and other time dependent variables
	- check behaviour when dag fail
    - send notif when dag run fail
    - discuss about airflow with other, especially data engineer, linkaja
