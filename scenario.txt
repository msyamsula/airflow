scenarios:
One (transform one to one table):
	i have database "source_db", table users with fields
		id, int
		username, string
		address, string
		is_active, string (yes|no)
		domicile, string
		balance, decimal
		point, decimal (1 poin equals to 10 rp)
	then i want to extract the data, and do following transform
		id -> leave at it is
		username -> change field name into user
		address -> leave at it is
		domicile -> drop it
		is_active -> transofrm into bool
        balance -> change to decimal(15,2)
        point -> change to decimal(15,2)
		net_worth -> sum of balance and point (net_worth = balance + 10 * point)
    load it into database "sink_db", table linkaja_user
Two (joining two tables):
	i have database "source_db", table "users" (as in scenario one), "account", and "full_service"
		account's fields are:
			id, int
			user_id, int, foreign key from table "users"
			account_name, string
		full_service's fields are:
			account_id, int, foreign key from table "account"
			full_service, bool
	I want to join this two table to become 
		"linkaja_account"
			id, int --> refer to account_id
			account_name, string
			full_service, bool
	load it to database "sink_db"
Three (splitting tables)
	i have database "source_db", 
		table "prize" consist of:
			id, int primary key
			account_id, int
			item_id, int
			item_name, string
			collected, bool
			value, decimal
	I want to split the table into "account", "items", and "(prize)account_item"
		account table:
			as defined in scenario two
		items' fields are:
			id, int primary key
			name, string
			value, decimal
		(prize)account_item's fields are:
			id, int primary key
			account_id, int
			item_id, int
			collected, bool
	Load it into "sink_db"


to-do :
	- get data from bigquery linkaja dataset
    - send notif when dag run fail
    - discuss about airflow with other, especially data engineer, linkaja
